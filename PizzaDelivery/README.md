# PizzaDelivery
## A simple Pizza Delivery App in C#
This Application allows the user to create their own Pizza from a variety of options and then displays the final order details and cost once ordering has been completed.

This is achieved with the use of object instantiation, their associated methods, a variety of loops and a switch statement. 

Bugs to fix:
* try/catch statements to ensure the incorrect user-input does not crash the program.
* Some additional detail in the menu is required, such as "Press 0 to exit toppings menu".


## Fixes in V2
* Additional detail and tidier formatting of text.
